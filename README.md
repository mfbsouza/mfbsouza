### Hey there! üëãüêß

#### Who am I?
I am a fun Brazilian how lives and breathes technology. Loves Linux, Loves Open-Source, Loves Hardware and Loves Gaming.
My greatest strengths are that I am extremely curious, can't settle before deeply understanding how something works,
and I'm tirelessly dedicated to developing well-designed, scalable and fast software solutions.

I've been working as a Software Engineer for 5 years now, and programming for 10 years. I have a bachelor's degree in
Computer Engineering and strong knowledge on Computer Architecture, Computer Networking, System Programming and 
Distributed Systems.

#### What's my main goal?
To use technology to build innovative solutions to problems and improve people's daily lives

#### My dream stack?
- Zig and C for system programming and low-level
- Lua as a embedded script language
- Go and TypeScript for daemons and back-end
- Python for developing tools

Let's connect!
