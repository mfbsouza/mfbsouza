Hi there!

I'm software engineer with 5 years of work experience. I have experience working with
Embedded Systems, Low Level Programming, Linux Systems and Backend development.

During my software engineering career, I've build strong skills in designing reliable
and scalable solutions. I've worked with multiple programming languages, libraries,
frameworks, and technologies such as C/C++, Go, Python, TypeScript, Docker, Jenkins,
Ansible, Linux Kernel and Drivers, RTOS, GNU Toolchains, Yocto Project, BuildRoot.

As a graduate Computer Engineer I have a solid knowledge over Computer Architectures,
Operating Systems and hardware/software system designs. And I recently completed 10
years as a programmer.
